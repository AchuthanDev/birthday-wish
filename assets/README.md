# Assets Folder Structure

This folder contains all the images and media files for the birthday website.

## Folder Structure

### `jk-slideshow/`
Place your Jungkook photos here for the slideshow section.

**Required files:**
- `jk1.jpg` - First Jungkook image
- `jk2.jpg` - Second Jungkook image
- `jk3.jpg` - Third Jungkook image
- `jk4.jpg` - Fourth Jungkook image

**Instructions:**
1. Add 4 or more Jungkook photos to this folder
2. Name them `jk1.jpg`, `jk2.jpg`, `jk3.jpg`, `jk4.jpg`
3. Recommended size: 800x1000px or similar portrait orientation
4. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP

**Note:** The website will gracefully handle missing images, but for the best experience, add your favorite JK photos here!

### `bts-logos/`
Place BTS logo files here if you want to use actual BTS logos in the particle animations.

**Note:** Currently, the website uses purple hearts (💜) for the floating particles. If you want to replace them with actual BTS logos, you can modify the particle rendering in `script.js` to load images from this folder.

## Tips

- Keep image file sizes reasonable (under 500KB each) for faster loading
- Use high-quality images for the best visual experience
- Make sure images are properly licensed if you're sharing the website publicly
